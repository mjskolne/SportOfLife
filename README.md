# Sport of Life :play_or_pause_button: :record_button: :repeat:
The create wonder game; a coaching philosophy, creative work in progress, a personal development guide, written as a we story and a gamification of life, to inspire, **for and by Mitch Skolnekovich**.

## About
In Sport of Life, we are lifelong student-athletes, and to win, we must overcome obstacles to become all we can be spiritually, mentally, and physically to contribute meaningfully; help others do the same and be an asset to the community. In short, Sport of Life is gamification of spiritual, mental, and physical pursuits, scoring points along the way, expanding on the basic idea of sports as a physical activity where creation is greater than competition.
