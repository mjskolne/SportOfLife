    About
    -----
    A Sport of Life program developed to encourage students to
    create beautiful plays, believing that creation is greater than competition.

    The word "basketball" is in quotes to indicate one perspective,
    the idea that anything is a sport and perhaps Play Creation could apply,
    imagine Play Creation "of Life", through different Sport(s) in Life!
