An Example of Player Choice for the Good of the Team
----------------------------------------------------
The games begins in the center circle when the ref tosses the ball in the air.
Our player gains control of the ball about 40 feet away from our basket, now what:
  1. Shoot the ball to score 3 points. They are 20 feet beyond the 3 point line and their 3P% from the line is 20%.
  2. Pass the ball to a teammate and move.
  3. Dribble the ball to move in order to make a better shot-attempt or pass.

To support our player with control of the ball:
  1. On shot, claim a spot and rebound the ball (if missed).
  2. Move to an open spot, closer to the basket, call for the pass.
  3. Set a screen (pick and roll, call for the pass).

I wonder what is the next choice to make and perform to help our team.
